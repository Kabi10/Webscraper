Pure Sunfarms,Cannabis,1,None provided,"Bought a 7g bag of pink kush, product isn't even hardly smokeable. The flower is brown like it's super old and lacks any  crystal stickiness  and any scent. Biggest waste of money I've spent at the cannabis store to date. I would highly recommend anyone stay away from this producer as I feel they have no quality standards and I am scared for My health to smoke this flower.  The price point was low but they should state on the bag that this is b grade flower at best",Customer,2025-01-07T17:11:12.270297

Pure Sunfarms,Cannabis,1,None provided,Usually their products are affordable and decent quality. However when you buy a premium product line and are missing a third as scaled by weight and reach out with no response in over a week I read between the lines. I will not make the mistake of buying from poor customer service companies again. Too many options. Start weighing your product everyone!,Customer,2025-01-07T17:12:15.342902
